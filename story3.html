      <p><font size="18"><font color="#FF69B4">1. CBGB Bar</p></font>

      <p>Probably the most famous punk bar in New York, the CBGB bar, which actually stands for  Country, Bluegrass and Blues,  finally closed its doors in 2008 after 33 years. The Ramones played their first gig here in 1974, and hardcore bands like the Meat Puppets, who joined Nirvana in their MTV unplugged in 1993 also played their first show here. This bar is mostly credited with giving musicians their first start ups. The Beastie Boys played the bar in November of 1982 trying to break into the punk scene. </p>

    <p><font size="18"><font color="#FF69B4">2. C-Squat Bar</p></font>

    <p> C (See) - Squat is a former squat house that was located on Avenue C, which is where it got its clever name. Many famous musicians and activists resided in the home. After a fire, the city took ownership in 1978 and squatters began to move in 1989. It was restored in 2002 and is now a part of the Museum of Reclaimed Urban Space, but before all of this the house was a small venue where bands like Leftover and Crack played. Crack makes a reference to the house in their song “Homeo Apathy” by referring to the “9th and C”. </p>

    <p>The Pyramid Club NYC opened its doors in 1979 and was a safe haven for the gay and drag community alongside hosting popular musicians at the start of careers. Both Nirvana and Red Hot Chili Peppers played their first New York show.  RuPaul, a drag queen, performed for the first time in New York City at The Pyramid as well. In October of 2012,  the building became a landmark in the Historic District of the East Vilagge. Today, the club hosts 80’s dance parties and post punk nights to hang on to it’s music nostalgia. </p>

    <p> This nightclub saw a shorter lived lifespan than some of the other punk bar’s in New York, but it was in its peak during the genesis of punk. It opened in 1965, and closed it’s doors in 1981. Andy Warhol and his entourage made this one of their most frequently visited spots in the city. It was also a mecca for the glam rock scene, where David Bowie, Iggy Pop, Alice  Cooper and the New York Dolls held performances. </p>
